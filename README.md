A demo application of a Bank of America and how it can can utilize Box to streamline its loan application process


### Design Decisions

I decided to make the visual very similar to Bank of America's actual loan application portal. I thought if I want the viewers to 
have a familiar feel, it would be beneficial to go through Bank of America's loan application process and use that as a base.

### Technical Hurdles

Initially, I thought I would be able to get down authentication relatively quickly but tinkering with the box-node-sdk package
was to no avail. I could not get it to work so I worked directly with the developer token and Javascript's fetch API. 

### Future Improvements

I would like to create a more dragged out flow such as a frontend log in page, a user's checking/savings balance, and go through
a more robust application flow.

OAuth2.0 with JWT is also something I'd like to include rather than updating the developer token constantly.
